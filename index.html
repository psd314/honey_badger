<h1> The Honey Badger </h1>
<img src="honey_badger.jpg">
<p>The honey badger, for its size, is the toughest animal on the planet.
It's both fearless and ferocious willing to take on anything from lions
to hyenas.  Honey badgers are also extremely intelligent and can often
escape their enclosures if anyone is foolish enough to try to contain
them.
