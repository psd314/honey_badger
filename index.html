<h1> The Honey Badger </h1>
<img src="honey_badger.jpg">
<p>The honey badger, for its size, is the toughest animal on the planet.
It's both fearless and ferocious and willing to </p>
<p>take on all comers, from lions
to hyenas.  Honey badgers are also extremely intelligent and can often
escape even the most</p>
<p>elaborate enclosures if anyone is so foolish as to try to keep one
in captivity.</p>
