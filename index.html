<h1> The Honey Badger </h1>
<img src="honey_badger.jpg">
<p>The honey badger, for its size, is the toughest animal on the planet.
It's both fearless and ferocious willing to </p>
<p>take on anything from lions
to hyenas.  Honey badgers are also extremely intelligent and can often
escape their enclosures if anyone is foolish enough to try to contain
them.</p>
